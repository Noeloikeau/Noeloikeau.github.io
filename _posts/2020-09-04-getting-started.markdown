In this post I'll describe how I setup this website. For now, I'll list some of the tutorials I followed:

[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

[ProgrammingHistorian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)

and summarize the key requirements:

{% highlight ruby %}
0. Create a GitHub account and repository for your site.
1. Install Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler.
2. Modify the resulting files to include what you want.
{% endhighlight %}
